# Zune Modding Helper

The Zune Modding Helper, or ZMH for short, is a portable tool for modifying the desktop Zune software. It includes the following mods:
- **Features Override:** Re-enables access to some features disabled by Microsoft, such as the Social and Marketplace tabs. Does not restore functionality of those features, but shows them in the software.
- **Fix Video Sync:** Resolves "Error C00D11CD" when attempting to sync video to a Zune device using Windows 10 1607 (Anniversary Update) or newer.
- **Community Webservices:** Partially restores online features such as the Marketplace by patching the Zune desktop software to use the community's recreation of Microsoft's Zune servers at zunes.me (instead of zune.net).
- **Background Image:** Replaces the "Zero" background with an image of your choice.
- **MusicBrainz ID Locator:** Puts MusicBrainz IDs added by MusicBrainz Picard and mp3tag where the Zune software can use it to show additional information provided by Community Webservices.
